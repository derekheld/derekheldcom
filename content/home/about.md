# Biography

I am an IT professional living in the Seattle area who loves all things tech. I am passionate about building secure networks and systems that help businesses succeed. My career has allowed me hands on experience deploying and managing a wide range of software in Linux and Windows environments along with various networking products from companies like Juniper, Cisco, and Fortinet. When not at work I often spend my time working on hobby projects or gaming.
